bio: |-
  I'm working at Sopra Steria as TechAdvocate and Engineering Platform leader.
  In my spare time, I'm the co-founder of Volcamp and of the meetup GreenTechAuvergne, also a GitLab Hero & a R2DevOps ambassador. I love coding and opensource, I'm the owner of 3 littles assets : svn2git, gitlab-emoji and heimdall (https://github.com/yodamad)

  All my contributions are available at https://me.yodamad.fr, I'm speaking in conferences and rewriting blog articles since 2022.
