  I believe that we can create products and services that make the world a better place. And that we can learn and grow in the process of doing so. Our challenge is that we waste time and money and human energy on untested ideas that, too often, turn out to be something that the customer does not want. Or, if we have an idea that is really good, we get in our own way by not executing it well, by not being able to communicate, inspire, and empower our collaborators and stakeholders as we must in order to do the impossible: launch and grow good ideas that the world needs, fostering sustainable and ethical growth.

  I work to solve that.
