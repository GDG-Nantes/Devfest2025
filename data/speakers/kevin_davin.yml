bio: |-
  Google Developer Expert on Google Cloud & Kotlin, Gitlab Hero, I am above all passionate about tech, languages, infrastructure, and automation. 
  Kotlin, Java, TypeScript are my day-to-day languages. I deploy all of those on the Google Kubernetes Engine with the GitLab's Continuous Integration ðŸš€. 

  Addict of agility and DevOps, some of my missions were to help teams to follow those philosophies. 
  From code quality analysis to unit or end-to-end tests setup all the way to continuous deployment and operation, I try to follow a project from birth to production. 

  I'm currently Principal Software Engineer at Gradle and mainly attached to [Develocity](https://gradle.com/develocity/), the product improving the developer productivity by reducing build and test time.
