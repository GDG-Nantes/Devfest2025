  Hi everyone! My name is Yulianna, and I am a Solutions Architect [Data & ML] at SFEIR. Even though I've always had a soft spot for data, I got the chance to participate in all phases of the software development lifecycle in my career path. At the moment, I enable data-driven decision-making by creating simple solutions that are easily maintainable, cost-effective, well-documented and documented, and most importantly, documented.
