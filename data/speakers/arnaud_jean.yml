  Arnaud JEAN (aka: **John Wick**), Developer Advocate with a particular set of skills!
 
  By day, he's crafting killer demos and slaying documentation dragons. By night, he's a regular on the conference circuit, delivering and assisting to insightful talks. Before going rogue as a Developer Advocate, Arnaud was an AWS Solutions Architect â€“ a past that comes in handy more often than you'd think!
