bio: |- 
  I'm Tiffany, Senior Developer Advocate in AI/ML at AWS 💻. I previously worked as a Data/ML engineer and Developer Relations at Microsoft. I'm a recurring speaker in the Underscore talk-show. I love engaging with developers about technologies, innovations and help them use our tools. My main focus are Artificial Intelligence 🤖, Cloud technologies ☁️ and Python 🐍 but I also love astronomy 🚀, genetic engineering 🧬, sports 🥋, animals 🐕, travels 🛫, gaming 🎮 and sharing a good meal with friends 🍲
