  Quantum computing is evolving rapidly—from theoretical promise to early practical applications. But what does that mean for software developers and architects today? This talk takes a grounded look at the current capabilities of quantum systems, the real limitations, and emerging hybrid approaches that combine quantum and classical computation.

  We’ll explore:
  - A technical overview of quantum computing principles (superposition, entanglement, gate vs. annealing models).
  - The landscape of current quantum hardware and its challenges (scalability, noise, error correction).
  - Use cases that are already delivering results, including logistics optimization and scheduling problems.
  - The role of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and where they outperform traditional methods.
  - A concise walkthrough of a demo: solving a real-world combinatorial problem using a quantum annealer on AWS.

  The session finishes on the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity and the current state of post-quantum cryptography and how to get started implementing these protocols. 

  This talk is for tech professionals who want a realistic, technically informed view of quantum computing today—beyond the hype—with insights into how to experiment and get involved.
