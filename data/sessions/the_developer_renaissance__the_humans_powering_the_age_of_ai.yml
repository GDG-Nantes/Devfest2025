  The Age of AI is not heralding the obsolescence of the developer, but rather igniting a "Developer RenAIssance." While artificial intelligence offers tools for coding, automation, and problem-solving, its true potential cannot replace developer ingenuity and creation. 
  This talk will explore the profound shift underway, arguing that as AI handles more of the rote and repetitive, while the uniquely human elements – creativity, critical thinking, ethical judgment, and collaborative spirit – become the primary drivers of developer innovation and value.
  
  We will delve into how AI is reshaping the developer landscape, from demanding new skill sets and development skills. Additionally, we’ll discover why technical communities, robust networks, and strong interpersonal connections are no longer just beneficial, but essential for navigating this new era. This session will illuminate how developers can thrive in the New Age of AI by upholding developer rooted traditions of community being a place for problem-solving, strategic thinking, and ethical considerations.
  
  Join to understand how developers are not just surviving, but actively powering the Age of AI, and how you can be at the forefront of this exciting Developer RenAIssance.
